StrongORM is an Object Relational Mapping (ORM) system. It operates on Sqlite3, interfacing with the database through the Sqlite3 gem.

Inspired by ActiveRecord from rails, StrongORM provides a connection to your database through representational Objects. These objects can represent either entire tables or individual rows. This allows for quick and easy interaction with your database, avoiding explicit SQL queries and bloated code.

For an example of StrongORM in action, please refer to the demo folder included in the github repo.
